Kickstart campaigns fund independent projects. To run a succesful kickstarter campaign one should take into consideration importnant variables like the number of donors, the donation goal, and the best time of year to run a campaign. Using global kickstarter data [Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](https://github.com/godak9/kickstarter-analysis/files/8904230/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) I narrowed my search down to theather/play campaigns and performed analyses on successful and unsuccessful campaigns that revealed trends on donation goals and launch times.
