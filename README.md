# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on global Kickstarter data to uncover trends in successful theather campaign 
##Overview 
Kickstart campaigns fund independent projects. To run a succesful kickstarter campaign one should take into consideration importnant variables like the number of donors, the donation goal, and the best time of year to run a campaign. Using global kickstarter data I narrowed down a search to data on theather campaigns and performed analyses that revealed trends on donation goals and launch times.
